### *-Point insertion-*

**G-man** \- "*Rise and shine Mr. Freeman, rise and shine. Not that I wish to imply that you have been sleeping on the job. No one is more deserving of a rest than you.*

*And all the effort in the world would have gone to waste until.... Well lets just say your hour has come again. The right man at the wrong place can make all the difference in the world. So wake up Mr. Freeman, wake up and smell the ashes.*

> *(The g-man slowly fades away into the background and his image is replaced with the viewpoint of Gordon Freeman on a train pulling into a station)*

### *-Dark Energy-*

**Alyx** \- *Oh my god, the portal is opening!*
**Dr. Breen** \- *I hope you have said your farewells.*

> *(Gordon uses the gravity gun to shot the energy orbesÂ into the portal)*

**Dr. Breen** \- *Go back Freeman, you have no idea what you are doing!*

> *(Gordon blows up the portal)*

**Dr. Breen** \- *NO! You need me!*
**Alyx** \- *Yes!*

> *(The shield covering the control room shuts off and Alyx steps out)*

**Alyx** \- *Yeah! You did it! Come on Gordon, we have got to get out of here, maybe we still have...*

> *(The portal collapses and explodes, time begins to slow down and a Mysterious man in a black suit slowly appears...)*

**G-man** \- *Time? Dr. Freeman? Is it really that time again? It seems as if you only just arrived. You have done a great deal in a small timespan. You have done so well, in fact that I have received some interesting offers for your services.* *Ordinarily I would not contemplate them, but these are extraordinary times.*

*Rather than offer you the illusion of free choice, I will take the liberty to choosing for you. If and when your time comes round again.*

> *(The background begins to fade to black, a greenish light appears)*

**G-man** \- *I do apologize for what must seem to you an arbitrary imposition, Dr. Freeman, I trust it will all make sense in the course of.. well.. I am really not at liberty to say.*

> *(The background turns to a black tunnel with white strands of light flying by)*

**G-man** \- *In the meantime, this is where I get off.*

> *(A door slides open in the air, the Mysterious man steps in and the door shuts behind him ...
> ... and the credits roll)*
